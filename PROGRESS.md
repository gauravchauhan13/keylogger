# PROJECT PROGRESS & AGENT HANDOFF

**Document:** `PROGRESS.md`  
**Status:** Living Document  
**Purpose:** Current development state and coding-agent handoff

---

# 1. Mandatory Agent Rule

This file must be read whenever a coding agent begins or resumes development.

Before stopping a development session, the agent must update this file.

This document answers:

> Where exactly is the project right now?

It must describe reality, not intended future state.

---

# 2. Project Status

```text
Overall Status:
IN PROGRESS

Current Phase:
Phase 1 complete; ready to begin Phase 2 (Data Foundation)

Current Objective:
Phase 1 Android Foundation complete: DI container (AppContainer), DispatcherProvider, Compose navigation graph with 6 foundation screens, MainActivity integration, unit tests passing, clean debug/release builds verified.
Ready to implement Phase 2 (Data Foundation / Room + SQLCipher).
```

Update these values as development proceeds.

---

# 3. Core Documents

Pre-development documentation:

```text
[✓] SRS.md
[✓] Architecture.md
[✓] DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md
[✓] IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
[✓] TESTING.md
[✓] SECURITY.md
[✓] PROGRESS.md

`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (Phases 0–21) is the authoritative implementation
roadmap. The package structure in `Architecture.md` (§10) is authoritative for
the source tree.

Phase-0 living documents (created and active):

[✓] decision.md
[✓] tech.md
[✓] flow.md
```

`decision.md`, `tech.md`, and `flow.md` are initialized and authoritative.

---

# 7. Next Tasks

Next tasks for Phase 2 (Data Foundation):

```text
1. Begin Phase 2 (Data Foundation).

2. Implement Android Keystore cryptographic key manager for database encryption key (DEC-005).

3. Define Room entities for MonitoringSession, InteractionEvent, and AppMetadata.

4. Implement Room DAOs with Flow query support and transaction boundaries.

5. Implement Room database configuration with SQLCipher OpenHelperFactory.

6. Implement DataStore preferences repository for application settings and onboarding state (DEC-009).

7. Add database unit and integration tests.

8. Update decision.md, tech.md, flow.md, and PROGRESS.md.
```

---

# 8. Current Technology

Until `tech.md` is initialized, the following is a recommended default stack, not the authoritative implemented stack:

```text
Platform:
Android

Language:
Kotlin

UI:
Jetpack Compose

Persistence:
Room

Concurrency:
Coroutines + Flow

Configuration:
DataStore

Keyboard:
InputMethodService

Interaction Monitoring:
AccessibilityService

Recommended Architecture:

Lightweight layered architecture
inspired by Clean Architecture

+ MVVM
+ Repository Pattern

Layers:
Presentation
Domain
Data
Platform

Build:
Gradle Kotlin DSL
```

This section is informational.

During Phase 0, evaluate these recommendations. `tech.md` becomes authoritative once it is created and records the actual stack.

---

# 9. Current Architecture

Canonical persistent event path:

```text
SOURCE
      │
      ▼
RawInteractionEvent
      │
      ▼
EventProcessor
      │
      ▼
Session Gate
      │
      ▼
Classification / SensitiveInputDetector
      │
      ▼
PrivacyFilter
      │
      ▼
ContextResolver
      │
      ▼
Repository Safety Validation
      │
      ▼
Encrypted Persistence Layer
      │
      ▼
Room
```

`Architecture.md` remains authoritative.

---

# 10. Current Application Flow

Planned:

```text
INSTALL
   ↓
OPEN
   ↓
DISCLOSURE
   ↓
PERMISSIONS
   ↓
ACCESSIBILITY SETUP
   ↓
ENABLE KEYBOARD
   ↓
SELECT KEYBOARD
   ↓
VERIFY
   ↓
DASHBOARD
   ↓
START SESSION
   ↓
MONITORING
```

Once `flow.md` exists, it becomes authoritative for current application flow.

---

# 11. Current Security State

Before implementation:

```text
Sensitive persistence:
NOT IMPLEMENTED

PrivacyFilter:
NOT IMPLEMENTED

SensitiveInputDetector:
NOT IMPLEMENTED

Repository safety validation:
NOT IMPLEMENTED

Export privacy validation:
NOT IMPLEMENTED

Encrypted persistence:

Secure key management:
NOT IMPLEMENTED

Encryption-at-rest test:
NOT RUN

Plaintext fallback test:
NOT RUN

Key-handling test:
NOT RUN

Backup/restore encryption behavior:
NOT DECIDED
```

Therefore persistent content-bearing IME event logging must NOT be considered ready.

---

# 12. Current Testing State

```text
Unit tests:
ACTIVE — 3 test suites / 5 tests passing (SanityTest, DispatcherProviderTest, NavigationRoutesTest) via testDebugUnitTest

Database tests:
NOT STARTED

Privacy tests:

# 14. Current Performance Baseline

Measured during Phase 1:

```text
Debug APK size:
48,720,225 bytes (~46.46 MB) — multi-ABI unminified with full Compose NavHost + 6 screens

Release APK size:
23,318,576 bytes (~22.24 MB) — multi-ABI, R8 minified + shrunk resources

Cold startup:
TBD (measured on physical/virtual device)

Idle RAM:
TBD

Active RAM:
TBD

Database size:
TBD (measured in Phase 2)

Keyboard latency:
TBD (measured in Phase 4/5)
```

# 15. Known Issues

Current:

```text
ISSUE-001
Description: Android Lint vital analyze release task fails under Java 25 runtime due to internal version parser limitation.
Severity: LOW
Status: MITIGATED
Resolution: Set lint { checkReleaseBuilds = false; abortOnError = false } in app/build.gradle.kts (DEC-012). Full R8 release compilation remains unaffected.
```

---

# 16. Current Blockers

```text
None. Project compiles, links, passes unit tests, and produces valid debug and release APKs.
```

---

# 17. Last Successful Build

# 21. Agent Start Procedure

Every coding session begins:

```text
READ PROGRESS.md
      ↓
READ decision.md
      ↓
READ tech.md
      ↓
READ flow.md
      ↓
READ relevant SRS sections
      ↓
READ relevant Architecture sections
      ↓
READ relevant Security/Testing rules
      ↓
INSPECT CURRENT CODE
      ↓
RUN BUILD/TESTS
      ↓
CONTINUE
```

Do not trust this document alone if source code contradicts it.

Investigate discrepancies.

---

# 22. Agent Stop Procedure

Before ending work:

```text
BUILD
  ↓
RUN RELEVANT TESTS
  ↓
REVIEW CHANGES
  ↓
REMOVE DEAD / DUPLICATE CODE
      ↓
OPTIMIZE WHERE JUSTIFIED
      ↓
RETEST
  ↓
UPDATE decision.md
  ↓
UPDATE tech.md
  ↓
UPDATE flow.md
  ↓
UPDATE SRS.md IF REQUIREMENTS CHANGED
      ↓
UPDATE Architecture.md IF ARCHITECTURE CHANGED
      ↓
UPDATE SECURITY.md IF SECURITY MODEL CHANGED
      ↓
UPDATE TESTING.md IF TEST STRATEGY CHANGED
      ↓
UPDATE DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md IF ENGINEERING RULES CHANGED
  ↓
UPDATE IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md IF DEVELOPMENT PLAN CHANGED
  ↓
UPDATE PROGRESS.md LAST
```

`PROGRESS.md` should normally be the final documentation file updated because it summarizes the resulting state.

---

# 23. Required Handoff Information

Before stopping, update:

```text
Current phase

Current objective

Completed work

Partially completed work

Next tasks

Known issues

Blockers

Last successful build

Tests run

Tests failing

Device tested

Important decisions

Documentation updated

Performance concerns

Security concerns
```

---

# 24. Partial Work Rule

Never mark a feature complete simply because files/classes exist.

Example:

```text
CustomKeyboardService.kt exists
```

does NOT mean:

```text
✓ Basic Keyboard Complete
```

Completion requires its relevant acceptance criteria and tests.

---

# 25. Build Failure Rule

If the agent stops while the project does not build:

`PROGRESS.md` MUST clearly state:

```text
BUILD STATUS: FAILING
```

and document:

```text
Error
Likely cause
Files involved
What was attempted
Recommended next action
```

Never leave the next agent assuming the project is healthy.

---

# 26. Test Failure Rule

Known failing tests must be listed.

Example:

```text
FAILED:

SensitiveInputDetectorTest.numericPassword

Reason:
Numeric password classification not implemented.

Next:
Add TYPE_NUMBER_VARIATION_PASSWORD handling.
```

---

# 27. Documentation Sync State

# 28. Recent Major Decisions

Summary of recent architectural decisions (see `decision.md` for full rationale):

```text
DEC-001: Kotlin as primary language
DEC-002: Jetpack Compose for host application UI
DEC-003: Room for structured local persistence
DEC-004: Manual DI instead of Hilt (saves ~300KB, improves startup time)
DEC-005: SQLCipher for Android + Android Keystore for AES-256 database encryption at rest
DEC-006: minSdk 31 (Android 12), compileSdk 35 (Android 15), targetSdk 35
DEC-007: Exclude database & preferences from cloud backup (allowBackup=false)
DEC-008: Kotlin Coroutines + Flow for asynchronous processing
DEC-009: Jetpack Preferences DataStore for user settings
DEC-010: com.example.inputmonitor package name
DEC-011: Gradle 9.3.0 wrapper for JDK 25 LTS runtime compatibility with AGP 8.7.3
DEC-012: Disable release build lint vital analysis due to JDK 25 parser limitation; enable debug signing on release build for test baseline
DEC-013: DispatcherProvider interface with DefaultDispatcherProvider for structured concurrency & testability
DEC-014: Sealed class hierarchy (Screen) for compile-time safe navigation routes
```

---

# 29. Immediate Next Action

At the end of every session there must be ONE clearly stated next action.

Current:

> Begin Phase 2 (Data Foundation): Implement Android Keystore key management, SQLCipher Room database configuration, domain/entity models, DAOs, and DataStore preferences repository.

This prevents a future agent from guessing where to resume.

---

# 30. Final Purpose

`PROGRESS.md` is the project's operational memory.

The documents answer different questions:

```text
SRS.md
→ What must exist?

Architecture.md
→ How is it structured?

IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
→ How do we build it?

DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md
→ How do we keep it efficient?

SECURITY.md
→ What security boundaries must never break?

TESTING.md
→ How do we prove it works?

decision.md
→ What did we decide and why?

tech.md
→ What technology are we actually using?

flow.md
→ How does the current system behave?

PROGRESS.md
→ Where exactly did development stop?
```

The coding agent must keep this document concise, factual and current.

It must never claim that an untested or incomplete component is finished.
